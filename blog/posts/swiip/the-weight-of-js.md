There are two principal measures for JS performance. The one which is focusing all the attention is DOM updating which is almost maxed out by recent frameworks. It is also really dependant of the application code and often not a real need of your application (who cares about milliseconds of rendering performances when your backend spent 2s for gathering your data?).

The other one, frameworks often don't even communicate on real figures, hide themselves behind features supposed to resolve the question like SSR, Tree Shaking or Lazy Loading. Yet, in many cases, it's a way more important performance issue than any other question of your JS app.

> It is the weight of your JavaScript code.

Never lose the thought that even if we see today websites as fully featured apps. It's still a platform where the whole app is downloaded, compiled and booted when you open your tab. Imagine that for Outlook, Word or Photoshop!

A webapp loading starts with the network bandwidth to download the file then the CPU to uncompress and compile it. The more code you got the most your app will need bandwith and CPU. Even then, more code will eventually mean a slower app. Look at this tweet from Nintendo.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Switch OS UI Session: in cutting player&#39;s wait time as much as possible, Switch&#39;s home menu design resources have less than 200KB. amazing. <a href="https://t.co/gnINFXnFPp">https://t.co/gnINFXnFPp</a></p>&mdash; Takashi Mochizuki (@mochi_wsj) <a href="https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1032276091279302656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2018</a></blockquote>

They have almost no network consideration to deal with (as far as I know) yet they care deeply at their app size for performances and fluidity.

Lastly: "less code is less bug". I always loved this quotation. Shipping less code (both yours and third parties) will always be a way to a better stability.

## Tools don't solve everything

A good part of the so rich Web tooling we use nowadays is about limiting the size of your JS. All of these techniques are optimizations which is great and I recommend to use almost all of them. Yet, optimizations are not solutions and the real amount of JS is still a question.

### Bundling

The first tool we use about JS performance is bundling. We don't serve the browser as many files as we develop knowing that every request to the server has its cost. Most of the time, we compile a bundle of one, two to five bundled JS file. Yet, you still has as much code as before.

### Minifying

Also for a long time, we use JS minification. It means to modify the code by removing most of the spaces, line breaks, rename variables to shorter names to have the same code with less characters and then, a smaller weight. It's great, it has almost no counterpart unless readability and then debuggability but it can be handled by the use of source maps.

Minification will reduce the weight of your JS from 50% to 90%! (if you have lots of comments ðŸ˜€)

### Compression

The most magical solution to reduce JS weight is binary compression. Most of the time, you don't even have to configure any tooling, it's your HTTP server which will compress your files with Gzip or Brotli. For best practices about compression, see this great article of [Antoine Caron](https://open-blog.dev/authors/slashgear) [Why you should use Compression Webpack Plugin?](https://open-blog.dev/posts/slashgear/why-you-should-use-compression-webpack-plugin/).

Like others, compression is great, you should definitely use it. Nevertheless, it doesn't mean you have free hand about the amount of JS you serve.

Firstly because no matters how great the percentage of reduction the compression offer, it's still a ratio of your original weight: 30% of 10MB is still 3MBâ€¦

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="//embed.chartblocks.com/1.0/?c=5ced4a1f3ba0f66a7e57560b&t=95e776621bbc403" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

Secondly because compression is only a network artifact. The amount of data to transfert on the wire is reduced but your actual amount of code is still the same. The browser will still have to parse and compile the same amount of code. Worst, the client will have to decompress the file before being able to use it. These steps could seem unimportant but on an old smartphone, it can be really slow, sometime longer than network time!

Take the example of [6play.fr](https://6play.fr/): 1MB of JS, 100ms compile time on my MacBook and up to 500ms with CPU throttling.

This illustration come from [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/) and its post [The cost of JavaScript](https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4). He's an important reference on the subject and producing measures on these type of things can be tricky.

Beware that most frameworks communicate only of their size after binary compression. "Preact: Fast 3kB alternative to React" but with an actual size of 8.7kB before compression (which is still great btw)

### Tree Shaking

Another magic feature to reduce the amount of code is called Tree Shaking. It's the ability in modern JS code to statically analyze imports in your code in order to automatically detect dead code and keep only what is used.

Frameworks like Angular have deeply invested on Tree Shaking optimizing their own source code to only imports what's needed to ensure that no part of the framework which is not needed is imported and then, produce bundle as small as possible.

Tree Shaking is great and mostly used by default in all common bundler. It's great to remove dead code from your bundles but, of course, it removes only what you don't use.

### Server Side Rendering

First of all, SSR is the ability of Web frameworks to be executed server side in order to serve a fully computed page in response of the initial request from the client allowing the user to see something during the time it loads the JS.

I'm a big fan of server side rendering yet today I will point its limitations.

SSR will reduce what we call the time to first paint (TTFP). The time between the initial request of the user and the time the user actually see something. It's important, especially for content websites and barely mandatory for SEO (most crawlers will not execute JS). Still, at the point of TTFP, you don't have any JS loaded and your page is not interactive.

After the JS is loaded, the framework will start over, "hydrate" the existing markup and only after being able to handle user events. We call this, time to interactive (TTI).

In some ways, SSR could even be counterproductive. Mainly because running the framework server side use time and resources when returning static resources is faster. Also because most frameworks, to be able to "hydrate", needs an export of the context used server side which can represents some weight too.

### Lazy Loading

In the early days of Single Page Applications (SPA), we started to bundle all our JS code. Which means that as soon as we arrive on a webapp, we transfered all the source code the app will ever need before doing anything. That was bad and fortunately, frameworks and tooling evolved to handle JS code lazy loading more and more simply.

Lazy loading well implemented means that you will start downloading only the code needed to bootstrap your application to get started. You will load the rest of your code only after when you will need it.

Still, if you need a lot of code to run your app, at one point or another, you'll need to load it.

### Compiling vsÂ Runtime

A new approach has appeared recently. By compiling some application code, they can reduce the size of the library left to load. In a compiler the common code used by the compiled code is called the runtime.

Two frameworks illustrate this concept. Angular, since its version 4 propose to compile template code at build time (the feature is called Ahead Of Time or AOT) to save up to the half of its size. The second one is Svelte, the first framework whose concept is to have no runtime at all.

Compiling is an interesting strategy but beware of backfire. Compiled code will ultimately be bigger than your source code and at one point, using a runtime could produce a smaller bundle.

### And soÂ onâ€¦

There is a lot of tools and strategies to reduce the weight of your JS. I didn't mentioned them all, there is left cache considerations, CDNs and I surely miss a few ones.

But you understand now that none of these technics are absolute, you still and always has to care about the weight of the code you ship.

## The weight ofÂ things

In order to being able to manage your app dependencies considering their weight, you have to know how much things weigh.

There is popular plugins like [VS Code Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) or [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) to show the weight of each import you do in your code.

![Bundle Analyzer](./assets/weight-of-js/webpack-bundle-analyzer.png)

They are pretty fancy but beware because the problem is that worrying of weight in your code editor is too late. You have to consider the matter before this when you choose your stack.

As explained before, there is different measures used commonly. Mainly before and after compression. To simplify, I will use the figures before compression (but after minification) for now on.

### Common frameworks andÂ library

Without larger comments, let see the weight of the most popular libraries commonly used nowadays (sorry if there is not yours)

- Lodash: 72kB
- jQuery: 86kB
- Backbone: 42kB (including Underscore but will need jQuery too)
- AngularJS: 172kB
- React: 117kB
- Angular: 299kB (bundle of a Hello World app) with AoT, 663kB with JiT
- Vue: 91kB
- Preact: 8kB
- Ember: 733kB (bundle of a Hello World app)
- Leaflet: 138kB
- Bootstrap: 152kB of CSS, 57kB of JS
- Bulma: 186kB of CSS

### Hello world weight vs real worldÂ weight

When it comes to JS Web Frameworks, figures has to be discussed furthermore.

Modern frameworks are deeply modular today. As much Angular which consider each modules as part of the framework or React which consider each as third parties. Yet you often need these modules for your app then considering only the core framework weight is a mistake.

It can create an important difference between the weight of an hello world app using only the core module of a framework and a real world app. The extensive use of Tree Shaking recently amplified the problem. The risk is that some framework would communicate on cool numbers with a very simple example using nothing and where Tree Shaking removed literally everything when the true size of the framework has not changed.

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="//embed.chartblocks.com/1.0/?c=5d1a1d2f3ba0f6d71e45627a&t=462bcc52236cd5f" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

In these measures, I bundled app with the framework, a state management framework, a router and a Material Design component library (with an import all to prevent Tree Shaking). We see that the initial weight of a framework does not necessarily indicates the final result. Yet, it looks like the Vue figure is mainly due to Vuetify which contains really a lot of components.

### The weight of yourÂ code

In any other platform I know of (surely it should exists on hardware development) the size of your own code doesn't really matters. I remember Java applications where there was hundreds of megabytes of dependency jars when my jar was one or two megabytes. It's not a troll about Java, it doesn't really matter in this case.

In frontend JS, you can't think that way. Your dependencies has to be small and your code can really quickly be bigger than your frameworks.

It's not necessarily wrong. Big webapps exist and they need code. But you have to know that it is an issue and use all the technics explained before to minimize the weight.

For example, I used to work on a big webapp where the vendors was about 350kb (after compression) and the specific code was about the same.

### The weight of otherÂ things

Until now, I only talked about weight of the JS files, yet a website is made of contents of several differents types. When you take care of the weight of your JS, you also have to considere the whole pictures.

Your website will surely contains also HTML and CSS, images, fonts, videosâ€¦

- Outside of special cases, HTML will be very light, yet it's always great to minify it.
- CSS could weights a few hundred kb to more than a Mb. So it has to be considered. Dead code elimination, lazy loading, minification, all of theses technics can be applied to CSS too.
- Images will often be the most heavy thing to load on your website. They have frequently be an excuse to not caring about JS size because "it's only a little percentage of the full page". Images are a really important matter of your page weight. You have to take care of really well optimize it, download the smaller version possible and sometimes just remove some. If images are handled carefully, they can weigh less than your JS.
- Fonts are a content type often ignored in web page optimization but they weigh a lot and are blocking to read something on the page.
- Videos are a really specific content type. It weigh a lot but are often not auto started and are streamed most of the time so in these cases, it does not impact the website load time directly.

According to [HTTP Archive State of the Web](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web), the average website weigh today 1.8MB on desktop and 1.6 on mobile. The share of JS in that weight is 22% or about 400kB (on the wire).

### Conclusion

The Web is a platform where no matter what you do, the weight of your code matter. We have an ecosystem full of great tools to optimize it yet there is no silver bullet and at one point or another, you will have to pay the price.

It brings the comunity to push forwards with new frameworks, new features without adding more line of codes sometimes even less (VueJS is smaller than AngularJS).

It has a very cool symbolic where each line of code is precious, highly well crafted and the comunity has to evolve with pure new ideas and never just stacking up new code over old one.
