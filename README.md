_Open Blog_ is a blog post _open source_ publication platform to let everybody share as many post as he/her want.
If you publish a blog post on your own blog, it won't have great visibility.
Gathering post on the same publication is a great way to share audience with the community.

## Why ?

Of course this type of platform already exists but they have an important problem: _an economic model_.

To summarize, sharing your articles on Open Blog is to guarantee to your users:

- no advertising
- no user tracking
- freely and without charge

Taking advantage of Github Pages and a travis deployment, Open Blog does not need to generate revenue.

## Features

- Markdown based
- I18n
- SEO tags
- Code snippets
- Images
- RSS feed
